## Weather Application

In the project directory, you can run:

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any errors in the console.


In this application I have used the two API's 
  1.  OpenWeatherMap open weather map will provide us with the weather data.
  2.  Unsplash API which will provide us with the images that we need.
